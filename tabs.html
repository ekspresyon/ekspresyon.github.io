Chivalry Is Dead Chords by Trevor Wesley

Capo on 1st fret
 
[Verse]
 
Bb                   C
Girl, just let your hair down
                  F
Let's paint the whole town
               Dm
Life is our playground, yeah
Bb                C
   But I'm not a kid no more
           Am                      Dm            C        Bb
So I must open doors and make you feel like the lady you are
          C               F
My momma raised me to be classy, not flashy
     Dm         C       Bb
I'm happy to please you
                          C                    Am     Dm
Though I can tell that's not what you're used to
 
 
[Hook]
 
Bb             C              F    Dm
   And they say chivalry is dead
            Bb                   C
Girl let a real man pick up the slack
                     Am      Dm
And treat you with respect, yeah
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                       Bb
And you don't have to love me
          C
Love me, Love me
                    F
You don't have to love me
          Dm
Love me, Love me
                   Bb                 C
Just cause I'm a gentleman don't mean
                       Am  Dm
I ain't taking you to bed
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
       Bb              C
Ahhh, baby let me buy your meals
                       F
I see your head over heels
     Dm                     Bb
I feel like you deserve it
(Bb)
There's no pressure
C                              Am          Dm   C
We can do whatever makes you comfortable, yeah
                    Bb
I could float your boat
                      C
If you're cold take my coat
                   F                            Dm
I'll sing a music note from a song that I just wrote
                   Bb
Girl just take my hand
           C
And let me be your man
Am                              Dm    C
  Though that's not what you're used to
 
 
[Hook]
 
Bb             C              F    Dm
   And they say chivalry is dead
            Bb                   C
Girl let a real man pick up the slack
                     Am      Dm
And treat you with respect, yeah
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                       Bb
And you don't have to love me

You don't have to love me
          Dm
Love me, Love me
                   Bb                 C
Just cause I'm a gentleman don't mean
                       Am  Dm
I ain't taking you to bed
 
 
[Bridge]
 
                    Bb
That's just how you treat a lady
         C             F
Treat a lady, Treat a lady
                Dm
Treat a lady, Treat a lady
          Bb
Treat a lady
C    Am    Dm
Dadadadadum
                     Bb
That's just how you treat a lady
         C             F
Treat a lady, Treat a lady
                Dm
Treat a lady, Treat a lady
          Bb
Treat a lady
C    Am    Dm
Dadadadadum
 
 
[Hook]
 
Bb             C              F    Dm
   And they say chivalry is dead
