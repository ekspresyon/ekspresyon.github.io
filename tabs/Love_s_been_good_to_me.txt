Capo 2nd fret (sounding key A major)
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
G              Am
 I have been a rover
D               G     C/G G
 I have walked alone
                Am
Hiked a hundred highways
D              G     /F#
 Never found a home
Em                Bm
 Still in all I'm happy
C                   Am7-5
 The reason is, you see
G         Am     C        Am7-5
Once in a while along the way
G           D       G
Love's been good to me
 
           Am      D
There was a girl in Denver
Am           D      G       /F#
  Before the summer storm
Em                 Bm
 Oh, her eyes were tender
C                  D
 Oh, her arms were warm
              G      B7      Em      G7
And she could smile away the thunder
C             Am7-5
Kiss away the rain
    G    Am           C     Am7-5
And even though she's gone away
    G          D     G
You won't hear me complain
 
G              Am
 I have been a rover
D               G     C/G G
 I have walked alone
                Am
Hiked a hundred highways
D              G     /F#
 Never found a home
Em                Bm
 Still in all I'm happy
C                   Am7-5
 The reason is, you see
G         Am     C        Am7-5
Once in a while along the way
G           D       G
Love's been good to me
 
            Am      D
There was a girl in Portland
Am           D      G       /F#
Before the winter chill
Em                 Bm
We used to go a-courtin'
C                  D
Along October hill
              G      B7      Em      G7
And she could laugh away the dark clouds
C             Am7-5
Cry away the snow
    G    Am           C     Am7-5
It seems like only yesterday
    G          D     G
As down the road I go
 
G              Am
 I have been a rover
D               G     C/G G
 I have walked alone
                Am
Hiked a hundred highways
D              G     /F#
 Never found a home
Em                Bm
 Still in all I'm happy
C                   Am7-5
 The reason is, you see
G         Am     C        Am7-5
Once in a while along the way
G           D       G
Love's been good to me
