Bb                   C
Girl, just let your hair down
                  F
Let's paint the whole town
               Dm
Life is our playground, yeah
Bb                C
   But I'm not a kid no more
           Am                      Dm            C        Bb
So I must open doors and make you feel like the lady you are

My momma raised me to be classy, not flashy
     Dm         C       Bb
I'm happy to please you
                          C                    Am     Dm
Though I can tell that's not what you're used to
 
 
[Hook]
 
Bb             C              F    Dm

            Bb                   C
Girl let a real man pick up the slack
                     Am      Dm
And treat you with respect, yeah

                       Bb
And you don't have to love me
          C
Love me, Love me
                    F
You don't have to love me
          Dm
Love me, Love me
                   Bb                 C

I'll sing a music note from a song that I just wrote

Girl just take my hand
           C
And let me be your man
