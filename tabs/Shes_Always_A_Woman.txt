[Verse 1]
        A7          D
She can kill with a smile
        A7             D
She can wound with her eyes
         D7       G              D      G
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies
         A7    D              A7           F#
And she only reveals what she wants you to see
    Bm           Em
She hides like a child
          G        A7       D
But she's always a woman to me
 
[Verse 2]
        A7          D
She can lead you to love
        A7          D
She can take you or leave you
        D7          G
She can ask for the truth
           D       G
But she'll never believe
           A7            D            A7          F#
And she'll take what you give her, as long as its free
    Bm            Em
She steals like a thief
          G        A7       D   D7
But she's always a woman to me
 
[Chorus]
Bm     E          E7         A     F#m
Ohhh..  she takes care of herself
                    G     Em
She can wait if she wants
       A7          D     D7
She's ahead of her time
 
Dm7   G7                   C    Am
Ohhh.. and she never gives out
                    Bb    E
And she never gives in
         E7          A     A7
She just changes her mind
 
[Verse 3]
A7                     D
And she'll promise you more
         A7        D
Than the Garden of Eden
            D7         G
Then she'll carelessly cut you
    D                  G
And laugh while you're bleedin'
           A7            D
But she'll bring out the best
        A7            F#
And the worst you can be
         Bm         Em
Blame it all on yourself
            G        A7       D
Cause she's always a woman to me
 
[Interlude]
A7  D  A7  F#  Bm  Em  G  A7  D  D7
 
[Chorus]
Bm     E          E7         A     F#m
Ohhh..  she takes care of herself
                    G     Em
She can wait if she wants
       A7          D     D7
She's ahead of her time
 
Dm7   G7                   C    Am
Ohhh.. and she never gives out
                    Bb    E
And she never gives in
         E7          A     A7
She just changes her mind
 
[Verse 4]
A7                D
She is frequently kind
          A7       D     D7
And she's suddenly cruel
                  G
She can do as she pleases
     D        G
Shes nobody's fool
        A7          D
But she can't be convicted
      A7           F#
She's earned her degree
        Bm            Bm/A
And the most she will do
         G          D/F#
Is throw shadows at you
          Em       A7       D
But she's always a woman to me
 
[Outro]
